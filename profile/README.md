# 🧠 ML Lab Summer 2025 — GitHub Organization

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **ML Lab Summer'25**, a collaborative learning space for fellow students exploring Machine Learning and Data Science.

---

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

Each member maintains their own journal/learning inside the org, following a unified course and lab structure.

```
Repo: <username>-journal/
└── C1-<Course-1-Name>/
    └── Week-1/
        └── Lab-1-<Lab-Name>.ipynb
    └── Week-2/
        └── Lab-2-<Lab-Name>.ipynb
└── C2-<Course-2-Name>/
    └── ...
```

## 🎯 Purpose

- Hands-on Machine Learning practice
- Weekly labs and personal experiments
- Version control and collaboration via Git & GitHub

---

## ✍️ Guidelines

- Each repo is owned by a member, named like: `username-journal`
- Follow consistent folder naming: `C1-<CourseName>/Week-#/Lab-#-Name`
- Use Markdown cells in notebooks for clarity and documentation
- Create a `README.md` inside your repo to describe your progress
